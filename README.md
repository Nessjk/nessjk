### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tony, half-English and half- Italian, but produced in France. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·   

I eat code for breakfast lunch and diner, luckily itâ€™s 0 calories. 

In tech for while now I've been in Sales, Product and Engineering. (not all at the same time) I co-founded my first tech startup at the non-ripe age of 25. Since, I matured into a full stack developer and worked on complex applications and websites.

In love with coding apps with a little extra flair and creativity with a business impact.
